# Guix MATE Unstable

This section of the repository holds incomplete, broken or bugged package
definitions that are not suited for users to install. These are not part of the
main channel exposed by the `.guix-channel` file, so users don't risk installing
these by mistake.

## Criteria

If a package breaks or if it installs incompletely or with bugs, it must be
moved here. Experimental packages or partial packaging efforts are also to be
placed here to avoid shipping incomplete packages to users.
