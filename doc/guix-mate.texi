@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This document exists to offer a Guix-like documentation for this particular
channel. It's heavily inspired on the @url{https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/, Original GNU Guix Manual}
but does not aim to copy or replace it, instead, this manual tries to be a
starting point for users migrating from both 100% Free and maybe not-so-free
Gnu/Linux distributions while explaining what's inside this repository, how to
replace the software you are used to in other distributions like Trisquel
and how to contribute to this repository.

@bye
