#### *won't upstream notices

Packages are marked as _wont' upstream_ won't be sent to upstream Guix for a
variety of reasons:

1. Packages with abandoned issues or merge requests.
2. These packages have took too much effort to create and there was not enough
   documentation or source code examples in upstream Guix.
3. Forks of discontinued projects, as that would mean I'll have to maintain a
   forked legacy project for a bigger userbase

This doesn't mean **you** cannot copy and attempt to send patches upstream for
these packages, it means I won't be maintaining those outside of this channel,
so updates, patches and bugs will be **yours** to take care of, or wait until I
notice and repeat the process **yourself**.

## Screenshots
