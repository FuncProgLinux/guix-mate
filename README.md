# GUIX MATE ðŸ¦¬ðŸ§‰

This channel tries to improve your MATE Desktop experience in GNU GUIX systems.

- Tired of your favorite GTK applications looking like `libadwaita`? We've got cross-platform xapps from Linux Mint adapted to GUIX. 
- Jealous of that Ubuntu audio indicator with music player controls?
- Running away from rust? MATE is almost pure C.

Return to the comfy *traditional* desktop everyone loved in the 2000's 

_This channel is still experimental. You can see package progress [here](https://codeberg.org/guix-mate/-/projects/13979)_

## Usage

This channel is not ready to be used. Grab an issue if you wish to help.

## Goals

- Rival Ubuntu MATE on software available for the MATE desktop.
- Patch upstream sources to remove `apt/dpkg` specific behavior
- Updates at least once per week/month, there's much room for improvement
- Rebrand if possible to improve user experience and integration with GUIX
