# GUIX MATE ðŸ§‰

Guix channel for MATE Desktop extra software.

This channel tries to improve your MATE Desktop experience in GNU GUIX systems.

- Tired of your favorite GTK applications looking like `libadwaita`? We've got
  cross-platform xapps from Linux Mint adapted to GUIX.
- Jealous of that Ubuntu audio indicator with music player controls?
- Running away from rust? MATE is almost pure C.

Return to the comfy _traditional_ desktop everyone loved in the 2000's.
