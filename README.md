# GUIX MATE ðŸ¦¬ðŸ§‰

This channel tries to improve your MATE Desktop experience in GNU GUIX systems.

- Tired of your favorite GTK applications looking like `libadwaita`? We've got cross-platform xapps from Linux Mint adapted to GUIX. 
- Jealous of that Ubuntu audio indicator with music player controls?
- Running away from rust? MATE is almost pure C.

Return to the comfy *traditional* desktop everyone loved in the 2000's 

_This channel is still experimental. You can see package progress [here](https://codeberg.org/guix-mate/-/projects/13979)_

## Usage

This channel is not ready to be used. Grab an issue if you wish to help.

## Workflow

Contributing to the existing Guix distribution is our primary goal. However, you may use this channel in case you want to test the packages before we present them to the Guix developers. If any of our packages doesn't get into the main Guix branch, we will still provide support for
it from here:

Here's the mermaid diagram of the current workflow:

## Upstreamed packages

The following packages are now part of GNU GUIX and are no longer present in this repository:

- `python-xapp`: Python bindings for `libxapp`

## Goals

- Rival Ubuntu MATE on software available for the MATE desktop.
- Patch upstream sources to remove `apt/dpkg` specific behavior
- Updates at least once per week/month, there's much room for improvement
- Rebrand if possible to improve user experience and integration with GUIX
- Upstream packages to GNU Guix to benefit trisquel users migrating
