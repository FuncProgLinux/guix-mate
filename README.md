# GUIX MATE 🧉

Guix channel for MATE Desktop extra software.

This channel tries to improve your MATE Desktop experience in GNU GUIX systems.

- Tired of your favorite GTK applications looking like `libadwaita`? We've got
  cross-platform xapps from Linux Mint adapted to GUIX.
- Jealous of that Ubuntu audio indicator with music player controls?
- Running away from rust? MATE is almost pure C.

Return to the comfy _traditional_ desktop everyone loved in the 2000's.

## Usage

Refer to this repository
[wiki](https://codeberg.org/guix-mate/guix-mate/wiki/Home.md) for more details.

> Starting from December 1st 2025 this channel won't be contributing packages

> Guix decided to neglect this particular desktop. It's a "consequence" not a

> desktop of my own so...yeah.
