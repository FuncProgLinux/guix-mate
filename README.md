# GUIX MATE ðŸ§‰

This channel tries to improve your MATE Desktop experience in GNU GUIX systems.

- Tired of your favorite GTK applications looking like `libadwaita`? We've got
  cross-platform xapps from Linux Mint adapted to GUIX.
- Jealous of that Ubuntu audio indicator with music player controls?
- Running away from rust? MATE is almost pure C.

Return to the comfy _traditional_ desktop everyone loved in the 2000's.

## Goals

- Rival Ubuntu MATE on software available for the MATE desktop.
- Patch upstream sources to remove `apt/dpkg` specific behavior
- Updates at least once per week/month, there's much room for improvement
- Rebrand if possible to improve user experience and integration with GUIX
- Upstream packages to GNU Guix to benefit trisquel users migrating
